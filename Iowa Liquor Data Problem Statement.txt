Iowa Liquor Data Problem Statement
The State of Iowa needs to establish predicted values around liquor sales in the state to more effectively anticipate revenue and identify possible gaps in compliance.
Utilizing the Iowa Liquor data, I will seek to answer what the forecasted dollar amount will be for the upcoming year, which counties and cities sell the most compared to which sell the least, and any additional insights that are gained in the analysis. With this information, the State of Iowa has the potential to forecast possible earnings from Liquor sales to calculate revenue earned from the Liquor tax, identify businesses to audit based on year-over-year sales to ensure compliance or insight to pass on to the Department of Health Services to increase alcohol awareness programs. The possible challenges in using this data will consist of incomplete records, any transactions not captured or accurately reported in this data set, the store number 2508 has variations on how the name was reported, the proximity to the local college or university and how that may impact sales. 
I will utilize predictive models and machine learning to prove and validate the predictive results.
